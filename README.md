# Core Algorithms 

Write tests and implementations for algorithms commonly used in job interviews.

An “algorithm” is a technical term for “a particular set of steps to solve a defined problem”. At the smallest scale, a sum() function is an example of an algorithm. At a large scale, the method by which Netflix recommends movies to its users is also called an algorithm.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the the core-algorithms repository and use the fork as your project artifact.
1. Use the list in the algorithms.md file as a reference for each algorithm.
1. In addition, consider doing one or more of the Courses on algorithms listed in the Resources.

## Context

Being able to design, implement, and test algorithms is a key skill for all programmers. Most of the algorithms you’ll encounter on the job will not fall neatly into the set of “common algorithms” specified here, but will be new problems for which you will have to find new solutions and adapt existing ones.

For this reason, developing the ability to do algorithmic thinking is a high-value skill.

In addition, many job interview processes will include some algorithmic problem-solving component, and it is useful to be familiar with some of the most common problems and good approaches to find their solutions.

To be totally clear, the algorithms you design here are totally contrived. They are useful to know because interviewers may ask you to solve problems like this (a controversial fact of the software engineering industry), but beyond that it is unlikely that you will ever write a merge sort algorithm as part of a web development job.

However, that doesn’t mean that they have no learning value. They are still useful as exercises in critical thinking, logic, and program design.
